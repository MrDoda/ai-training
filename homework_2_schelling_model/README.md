# Schelling's Model Simulation

This project simulates Schelling's segregation model in 2D using Pygame.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

You can install Pygame with pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Simulation

- To run the simulation with the default satisfaction threshold (0.5):
```bash
python main.py --threshold 0.3
```

## Controls

- 1 Step: Apply one simulation step.
- 10 Steps: Apply ten simulation steps.
- AUTO: Toggle auto-mode (a step is executed every 10 frames).
